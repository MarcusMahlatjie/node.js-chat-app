# Realtime Chat-app

This is a real time chat app that allows real-time messaging between users, read receipts, image and file support and more. This app is built using NodeJS, React and makes use of ChatEngine.IO
Insipred by the widespread doubt over the privacy and security of larger chat app platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat etc. I am hoping to scale it into something larger and focus more on the backend to incorporate end-to-end encryption and better messaging security in general.

## Project structure
This project has been broken down into two simple sections; Frontend and Backend. The backend was built using NodeJS and implements ChatEngineIO as an API to handle our chat engine functionality. The frontend was built using React.

## Run using "npm run dev"
This app can be run locally on your device at the following port: http://localhost:5173. Please ensure that the NodeJS server is running for the site to be visible and fully functional. To start the NodeJS server you can use "npm start run"
