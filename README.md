# Realtime Chat-app

This is a real time chat app that allows real-time messaging between users, read receipts, image and file support and more. This app is built using NodeJS, React and makes use of ChatEngine.IO
Insipred by the widespread doubt over the privacy and security of larger chat app platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat etc. I am hoping to scale it into something larger and focus more on the backend to incorporate end-to-end encryption and better messaging security in general.
